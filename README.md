Firstly something to test [gd-gumbo](https://github.com/quantumedbox/gd-gumbo) for, but there's neat potential with this.

## Goals

- Simple attributes, such as links
- Inline text tags for styling of text

## Experimental goals
- Usage of GDScript as document scripting language
- Ability to load Godot scenes as documents, and integrate them into page directly
