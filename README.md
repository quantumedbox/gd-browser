## TODO
- Interpreting of basic sectioning elements
- Simple attributes, such as links
- Moving to new pages by clicking links
- Inline text tags for styling of text, probably by using RichTextLabel and BBCode
- Parsing of HTTP response headers

## Experimental TODO
- Usage of GDScript as document scripting language
- Ability to load Godot scenes as documents, and integrate them into page directly
