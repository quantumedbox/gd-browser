# gd-browser Simplistic Browser Project
Firstly something to test [gd-gumbo](https://github.com/quantumedbox/gd-gumbo) for, but there's neat potential with this.

## Demo

## TODO
- Interpreting of basic sectioning elements
- Simple attributes, such as links
- Inline text tags for styling of text, probably by using RichTextLabel and BBCode
- Image loading
- Parsing of HTTP response headers

## Experimental TODO
- Usage of GDScript as document scripting language
- Ability to load Godot scenes as documents, and integrate them into page directly
